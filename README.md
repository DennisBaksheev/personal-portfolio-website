# My Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, which I created from scratch using Tailwind CSS and deployed to the server using Netlify. In this project, I worked with JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS to build a responsive website that showcases my skills and projects.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**
- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Netlify**

## Features

Here are some of the features I implemented in this project:

- **Smooth Scroll**: I used the react-scroll library to create a smooth scrolling effect when users click on links in the navigation menu.
- **Social Icons**: I added icons linking to my social media profiles in the footer of the website.
- **Custom Fonts**: I used Google Fonts to choose and import custom fonts for my website.
- **Gradient Background**: I created a gradient background using Tailwind CSS classes.
- **Responsive Design**: I used Tailwind CSS's responsive design classes to ensure that my website looks great on all screen sizes.
